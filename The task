The task
--------

Using HTML and Javascript, build a single web page web application using AngularJS that given a user selecting their institution and entering their module code, will display some of the details of their Aspire reading lists.

You can use Talis Aspire's APIs - the List linking API and Linked Data API will be of most interest. Documentation for these are available at http://support.talisaspire.com/forums/20059211-APIs

We are interested in looking at how you structure the code for maintainability, following the framework norms and your assessment of what Angular gives over straight JS development with/without JQuery 

We are also interested in your feedback on the experience of using the APIs, and what you might suggest for improving it.

You should spend between 4 and 6 hours to complete the task, and are likely to be asked about how your time was spent.

Please attend the interview ready to present to us on the task. The presentation should cover:

路  A demo of the application

路  A walk through of the source code

路  Your experience of using the APIs

路  Other observations that you think are relevant to this task.

Your presentation should be around 20 minutes, and will be followed by questions from the panel and further discussion.
