<h2>The task</h2>

<p>Using HTML and Javascript, build a single web page web application using AngularJS that given a user selecting their institution and entering their module code, will display some of the details of their Aspire reading lists.</p>

<p>You can use Talis Aspire's APIs - the List linking API and Linked Data API will be of most interest. Documentation for these are available at <a href="http://support.talisaspire.com/forums/20059211-APIs" targer="_blank" >http://support.talisaspire.com/forums/20059211-APIs</a></p>

<p>We are interested in looking at how you structure the code for maintainability, following the framework norms and your assessment of what Angular gives over straight JS development with/without JQuery<p>

<p>We are also interested in your feedback on the experience of using the APIs, and what you might suggest for improving it.</p>

<p>You should spend between 4 and 6 hours to complete the task, and are likely to be asked about how your time was spent.</p>

<p>Please attend the interview ready to present to us on the task. The presentation should cover:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A demo of the application</li>
	<li>A walk through of the source code</li>
	<li>Your experience of using the APIs</li>
	<li>Other observations that you think are relevant to this task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your presentation should be around 20 minutes, and will be followed by questions from the panel and further discussion.</p>
